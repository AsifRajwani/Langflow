## **LangFlow Tutorial Examples**

This repository contains code examples from the official [LangFlow tutorials](https://docs.langflow.org/). The code is written in **TypeScript** and demonstrates how to interact with flows created using the **LangFlow Desktop App**.

Each example resides in its own directory and includes the exported LangFlow JSON file, allowing you to easily import and use the corresponding flow.

## **üìù Requirements**

To run these examples, you need the following:

- **Node.js**: Version 22.15.x or above. You can download it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **LangFlow Desktop App**: Download and install it from [langflow.org/desktop](https://www.langflow.org/desktop).
- **OpenAI API Key**: Some examples require an OpenAI API key. You can get one by creating an account on the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

## **‚öôÔ∏è Setup**

1.  **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the repository with the following variables:

    ```ini
    LANG_FLOW_API_KEY=your_langflow_api_key
    LANG_FLOW_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://your_langflow_server_address:7860
    SIMPLE_AGENT_FLOW_ID=your_simple_agent_flow_id
    VECTOR_STORE_RAG_FLOW_ID=your_vector_store_rag_flow_id
    INJEST_FILE_CHATBOT_FLOW_ID=your_injest_file_chatbot_flow_id
    ```

2.  **Build the Project**: Use the TypeScript compiler in watch mode to automatically compile your code.

    ```bash
    tsc -w
    ```

## **üöÄ Examples**

### **1. Simple Agent**

This example corresponds to the [LangFlow quickstart tutorial](https://docs.langflow.org/get-started-quickstart). It demonstrates a basic, pre-configured agent that uses a single tool (the Calculator) to show fundamental functionality.

- **To run**:
  ```bash
  node dist/simple-agent/simple-agent.js
  ```

### **2. Connect Applications to Agents**

#### **Troubleshooting & Usage Notes for CSV File and Directory Handling**

1. **Directory Component Path**: Setting up the directory path in the LangFlow directory component does not work as expected. You need to place your CSV file in the working directory. Copy the `customer-orders.csv` file from the `customer-order` directory to your default working directory.

   **What is the working directory?** For the LangFlow Desktop app, the working directory is the folder where LangFlow looks for files by default. On Mac, if you start LangFlow from the toolbar (not the terminal), this is usually `~/.langflow/data`. If you start LangFlow from the terminal, the working directory will be the folder from which you launched the app.

2. **CSV File Access**: Initially, LangFlow may not read the CSV file and might say it does not have access to order history. If this happens, try entering a prompt like: `Where you are looking for purchase data I uploaded csv already.` After this, it should start working and access your data.

3. **Session Creation & First Run Workaround**: Running the TypeScript program will create a session with your user email, but it may not work on the first try. You can go to the LangFlow playground and use the prompt `Where you are looking for purchase data I uploaded csv already.`. After this, run the TypeScript program again and it should work!

4. **Hardcoded Email Address**: The email address is hardcoded in `src/app-to-agent/app-to-agent.ts`. Please change it in the code to try different user IDs as needed.

This tutorial focuses on how to **build an agent** within LangFlow itself. It teaches you to design and assemble an agent by connecting components and tools, such as a calculator and a web scraper.

- **To run**:
  ```bash
  node dist/agent-tutorial/agent-tutorial.js
  ```

### **3. Vector Store RAG**

This example demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It shows how to create a chatbot that can answer questions based on a provided document. Note that the behavior of this flow can sometimes be inconsistent.

- **To run**:
  ```bash
  node dist/vector-store-rag/file-upload.js
  ```

### **4. Chatbot that Ingests Files**

This example shows how to create a chatbot that can ingest files, as described in the [LangFlow "Chat with Files" tutorial](https://docs.langflow.org/chat-with-files). It demonstrates the process of uploading a file and passing its path to the flow.

- **To run**:
  ```bash
  node dist/injest-file-chatbot/injest-file-chatbot.js
  ```

### **5. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tutorial**

This example explains the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and how to use LangFlow as both an MCP **client** and a **server**. It demonstrates how to expose your flows as tools for other applications.

- **To run**:
  ```bash
  node dist/mcp-tutorial/mcp-tutorial.js
  ```
