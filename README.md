## **LangFlow Tutorial Examples**

This repository contains code examples from the official [LangFlow tutorials](https://docs.langflow.org/). The code is written in **TypeScript** and demonstrates how to interact with flows created using the **LangFlow Desktop App**.

Each example resides in its own directory and includes the exported LangFlow JSON file, allowing you to easily import and use the corresponding flow.

## **üìù Requirements**

To run these examples, you need the following:

- **Node.js**: Version 22.15.x or above. You can download it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **LangFlow Desktop App**: Download and install it from [langflow.org/desktop](https://www.langflow.org/desktop).
- **OpenAI API Key**: Some examples require an OpenAI API key. You can get one by creating an account on the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

## **‚öôÔ∏è Setup**

1.  **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the repository with the following variables:

    ```ini
    LANG_FLOW_API_KEY=your_langflow_api_key
    LANG_FLOW_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://your_langflow_server_address:7860
    SIMPLE_AGENT_FLOW_ID=your_simple_agent_flow_id
    VECTOR_STORE_RAG_FLOW_ID=your_vector_store_rag_flow_id
    INJEST_FILE_CHATBOT_FLOW_ID=your_injest_file_chatbot_flow_id
    ```

2.  **Build the Project**: Use the TypeScript compiler in watch mode to automatically compile your code.

    ```bash
    tsc -w
    ```

## **üöÄ Examples**

### **1. Simple Agent**

This example corresponds to the [LangFlow quickstart tutorial](https://docs.langflow.org/get-started-quickstart).

- **To run**:
  ```bash
  node dist/simple-agent/simple-agent.js
  ```

---

### **2. Vector Store RAG**

This example demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Note that the behavior of this flow can sometimes be inconsistent.

- **To run**:
  ```bash
  node dist/vector-store-rag/file-upload.js
  ```

---

### **3. Chatbot that Ingests Files**

This example shows how to create a chatbot that can ingest files, as described in the [LangFlow "Chat with Files" tutorial](https://docs.langflow.org/chat-with-files).

- **To run**:
  ```bash
  node dist/injest-file-chatbot/injest-file-chatbot.js
  ```
